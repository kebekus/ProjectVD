# Divisors on subsets of normed fields

This file defines divisors, a standard book-keeping tool in complex analysis
used to keep track of pole/vanishing orders of meromorphic objects, typically
functions or differential forms.

## TODOs

- Extensionality lemmas
- Group structure
- Partial ordering
- Restriction and extension of divisors as group morphisms
- Decomposition into positive/negative components
- Constructions: The divisor of a meromorphic function, behavior under product
  of meromorphic functions, behavior under addition, behavior under restriction
- Local finiteness of the support
- Degree
- Nevanlinna counting functions
- Construction: The divisor of a rational polynomial
