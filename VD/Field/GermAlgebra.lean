# Germs of Algebra-Valued Functions

Let `l` be a filter on a type `α`. Two functions `α → A` have the same germ along `l` if they agree
eventually along `l`; for example, if `l` is the neighborhood filter of a point, germs are germs
in the usual sense. If `A` is an `R`-algebra, then the ring of germs `Germ l A` is an `R`-algebra,
and the map sending a function to its germ is an algebra homomorphism `Filter.Germ.coeAlgHom`.

/--
If `A` is an `R`-algebra, then germs of `A`-valued functions form an `R`-algebra. The scalar
multiplication is the existing one on germs, acting pointwise on representatives.

The image of a scalar `r` in the algebra of germs is the germ of the constant function with value
`algebraMap R A r`.
